# TridentDupe
Minecraft Duplication Glitch working for 1.13+ to dupe tridents.



Meteor Client Addon - Developed by Killet, Laztec, and Ionar. This works on all servers currently, for all versions with tridents.  (Also works for arrows!)
---Does not work for Riptide


Enjoy! Even works in single player! ! !

Enable trident dupe with a Trident in your first hotbar slot!
